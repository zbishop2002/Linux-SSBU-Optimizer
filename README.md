# SuyuSSBUOptimized

## Linux alternative for the SSBU optimizer for Yuzu
SuyuSSBUOptimized provides a portable Suyu AppImage setup for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU), pre-configured with the same mods as the Windows version. When launched using `suyu-ssbu-optimized.sh`, the AppImage uses /SuyuSSBUOptimized/home/ as its home folder, making it a fully isolated Suyu instance for online play. You can place the base directory SuyuSSBUOptimized anywhere, but the launcher script uses relative paths so its contents need to maintain the same position relative to the base directory.
