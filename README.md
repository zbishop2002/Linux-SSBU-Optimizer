## Linux alternative for the SSBU optimizer for Yuzu
SuyuSSBUOptimized provides a portable Suyu AppImage setup for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU), pre-configured with the same mods as the Windows exclusive [yuzu-ssbu-optimizer](https://github.com/saad-script/yuzu-ssbu-optimizer). When launched using `suyu-ssbu-optimized.sh`, the AppImage uses **/SuyuSSBUOptimized/home/** as its home folder, making it a fully isolated Suyu instance for online play. You can place the base directory **SuyuSSBUOptimized** anywhere, but the launcher script uses relative paths so its contents need to maintain the same position relative to the base directory.
